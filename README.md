of customer feedback to understand product sentiment accurately. Understanding customer
sentiment is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions about product improvements,
marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction. However, manually analyzing thousands of
product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, there is a need for an automated
sentiment analysis solution to process and interpret these reviews efficiently.
